        "description": "Nitrate (Performance Optimizer) is a mod for Terraria created to significantly improve the game's performance by introducing extensive optimizations to various functions. The mod takes advantage of parallelism, SIMD instructions, GPU rendering and other modern technical solutions designed to increase the speed and stability of the gameplay.\n\nPlease note:\nNitrate is in early development; Some features may not be compatible with other mods.\nBalance between performance and accuracy: We strive to find the perfect balance between game speed and visual fidelity.\nSave Security: Your saves should be safe, but visual distortions and glitches may occur.\n\nMain characteristics of the mod:\n\tDust particle processing: Rewritten and optimized for GPU, which significantly increases performance (requires testing with modified particles).\n\tParallelization of particle update: Increases game speed by simultaneous processing.\n\tRain visualization on GPU: optimized so that most of the processing occurs on the video card (may not work correctly with mods that change the textures or color of rain).\n\tParallelization of rain update: Increase productivity through more efficient processing.\n\tReplacing FNA types with SIMD: Important parts of the code now use JIT internal SIMD types to optimize execution.\n\tTiled rendering and lighting: rewritten to be chunk-based and partially processed on the GPU (the current version may have bugs, for example, when using spelunker potions).",

Problems may arise when used in conjunction with other mods and monitor requirements. Recommended use with caution.\n\nHigh FPS support:\nAllows Terraria to render over 60 frames per second without changing the speed of the world simulation.\nClient optimization:\nThe mod is completely client-side and does not affect server mechanics when playing in multiplayer mode.\nGame speed settings:\nIn a single-player game, configuration settings are available that allow you to speed up or slow down the game for fun.\nOptimizations for high FPS:\nIncludes several optimizations designed to help achieve high frame rates. These optimizations are disabled by default and can be enabled through the mod's config file.\nPotential problems:\n\nMonitor requirements:\nFor the mod to work correctly, you must disable the frame skip function in the game settings (“Frame Skip” must be set to “Off”), and also use a monitor with a refresh rate higher than 60 Hz.\nVisual glitches:\nOccasional minor visual inconsistencies or artifacts may occur.\nCompatibility with other mods:\nCompatibility with other mods is not guaranteed. Significant visual glitches may occur if other mods render objects in an incompatible manner. Solving these problems is only possible if the authors of other mods add support for this mod.",

Then equip it into your active accessory slot to have the contents of that chest added to your stats. It is limited by settings (default is disabled or set to 0) and each chest is only processed once, but you can share chests with other players.\nAdditionally, the chest accessory activator must be set up every time you enter a world (it doesn't save the chest it's on for common sense reasons), so every time you enter a world you need to open the accessory chest and use the activator chest accessories on it. This is a mod that does not aim to balance the game. Consider it a less cheating alternative to other similar mods.\nChanges in version 0.6:\n\nAdded piggy bank accessory activators as an alternative to filling the entire inventory with accessories:\nThey completely replace the use of the main inventory slots for accessories, so you cannot use, for example, an accessory activator from the bottom row with an accessory activator for a piggy bank.\nThey can still be equipped together, but only the one found first will be used.\nThe order of activating accessories and searching for armor is as follows: vanilla accessory slots, vanilla armor slots, hotbar, and then either the piggy bank or inventory from the first row to the last.\nThe ability to change configuration on servers has also been temporarily changed (you must be the first player on the server to make changes).",

        "description": "This mod aims to add variety to the world generation process without violating the core principles of the original generator, aiming to remain as close to the vanilla version as possible.\n\nMain features of the mod:\n\nCompatible with vanilla and custom seeds: The mod allows you to combine different seeds with vanilla and custom options, so you can enjoy both \"For the Worthy\" and \"Drunk\" world generation, as well as other variations.\nPossibility of choosing seeds: You can select different seed options using the gear icon located to the right of the seed input field in the world creation UI.\nDisabling secret seeds: The mod removes the standard way to activate secret seeds, so no seeds will trigger a secret anymore, they can only be activated through the options UI.\nAdditional world generation improvements: In the mod settings you can enable the recommended additional improvement in world generation. It changes the generation process slightly, but at the same time significantly speeds it up, especially for large worlds, and fixes some problems.\nSetting the world size: The mod also has the ability to customize the size of the world. It already works quite well, except for some graphical bugs associated with the vanilla version. Custom world size works best in combination with improved world generation and may be necessary in some cases. However, it's worth noting that if your world's width to height ratio is significantly different from vanilla, the generation may look unusual (at least for now).\nCompatible with other mods: This mod is compatible with almost all other mods and I try to fix problems as soon as they are reported. However, there is a known compatibility issue with the Calamity mod, but it should be fixed by the developers of this mod. In any case, this mod by itself cannot cause a problem. If someone tells you to turn it off, that's stupid. If you want to fix a problem with another mod yourself, pay attention to the following possible reasons:\nSome mods do not support the world size you choose, try to get closer to the vanilla size.\nSome options you have enabled may not be supported in combination with other mods.\nIt is possible that the additional generation enhancement option conflicts with another mod, although this is unlikely.",

This mod allows players to install vaults that automatically sort and store items in the game, making inventory management much easier.\n\nList of storages added by the Magic Storage mod:\n\nStorage Heart is the foundation for organizing storage. It is installed first and serves as the basis for the rest of the storage.\nStorage Units are basic storage units that can store many items. They can be upgraded to have more capacity and various features such as quick access to items and automatic sorting.\nThe Crafting Interface is a repository that gives players access to materials and recipes for crafting items.\nCrafting Storage is an advanced variant of the Crafting Interface that can also store and organize items needed for crafting.\nItem Collector is a device that automatically collects items dropped from mobs and blocks. It can also be configured to collect certain items.\nItem Router is a device that automatically redirects items from one storage to another depending on specified conditions. It can be used to automatically sort items in storage areas.\nRemote Storage Access is a device that allows players to access their storage from anywhere in the world, just by having an active Storage Heart.\nAll of these storages can be configured to work with different items and materials, and can be easily rearranged and modified depending on the players needs. Magic Storage greatly simplifies gameplay by allowing players to focus on exploring and crafting rather than managing their inventory.",

When using Night's Conversion, you can craft 3 new swords, each of which have some relation to one of the swords that went into the Night's Edge. The regular Night's Edge is assumed to be the Light's Bane version for this mod.\n\nWhat does Night's Conversion add?\nThe first sword added is the Night's Katana. The Night's Katana has the added ability of autoswing, inherited from the Muramasa. While swinging the sword, monster spawns are also increased, due to the fact that you receive the Water Candle debuff.\nThe second sword added is the Night's Jungle. The Night's Jungle has the ability to poison enemies on contact, inherited from the Blade of Grass. Unlike the Blade of Grass, the Poisoned debuff is applied 100% of the time and lasts for 3 seconds.\nThe third sword added is the Night's Flame. The Night's Flame has the ability to burn enemies on contact, inherited from the Fiery Greatsword. The On Fire! debuff is always applied for 3 seconds.",

At the same time, they emphasize the quality and compliance of the bosses with the vanilla style of play. Now in this mod there are 8 new bosses, new weapons, armor and other items.\n\nDetails about bosses\n\nThe polarities\nA couple of bosses that always remain on opposite sides of the player. They drop several powerful weapons and materials to create a unique set of armor, as well as a useful exclusive accessory for experts. Designed to fight after the golem.\nSun pixie\nA giant pixie that bombards the player with lasers and deadly beams. Drops several solar-themed weapons useful for mechanical bosses. Designed to fight up to furs.\n\nStorm Cloudfish\nAn early rain boss that drops several useful early game accessories and a rain switch. Designed to fight up to EoC.\n\nEclipxie\nA much more difficult version of the Sun Pixie that fought during a solar eclipse. Some of his drops are enhancements to the Sun Pixie drops, while others are more unique. Designed to fight after the golem.\n\nGigabat\nA massive cavern-fighting bat that summons a swarm of minions to defend itself and attack the player. Uniquely, it is triggered by the release of gems (crafted from gems and fireflies) in the cave layer. The more gems are released and the higher the level of the stone from which they are made, the faster the bat will arrive. Designed to fight shortly before the queen bee.\n\nStar construct\nThe boss is best described as an unholy, screaming mix of Golem, Planter, and a player who has just discovered grappling hooks, designed to fight around the same time as the world evil bosses (World Eater / Brain of Cthulhu). He sometimes falls from the sky while sleeping and can be awakened by hitting him multiple times, although the player can also summon him manually.\n\nEsophage\nA boss dedicated to both world disasters unlocks access to an alternate world evil after being defeated, designed to fight around the same time as Plantera. Surprisingly resembles a jumping spider.\n\nHemorrhage\nA much more powerful version of Esophagus that fought during the Blood Moon. Since the original wasn't creepy enough, it has longer and thinner legs. Designed to fight after the golem.\n\ntModLoader v0.11.8",
