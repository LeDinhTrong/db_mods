Unlike the Blade of Grass, the Poisoned debuff is applied 100% of the time and lasts for 3 seconds.\nThe third sword added is the Night's Flame.

        "description": "The authors of The Polarities mod focused on adding new bosses to Terraria. At the same time, they emphasize the quality and compliance of the bosses with the vanilla style of play. Now in this mod there are 8 new bosses, new weapons, armor and other items.\n\nDetails about bosses\n\nThe polarities\nA couple of bosses that always remain on opposite sides of the player. They drop several powerful weapons and materials to create a unique set of armor, as well as a useful exclusive accessory for experts. Designed to fight after the golem.\nSun pixie\nA giant pixie that bombards the player with lasers and deadly beams. Drops several solar-themed weapons useful for mechanical bosses. Designed to fight up to furs.\n\nStorm Cloudfish\nAn early rain boss that drops several useful early game accessories and a rain switch. Designed to fight up to EoC.\n\nEclipxie\nA much more difficult version of the Sun Pixie that fought during a solar eclipse. Some of his drops are enhancements to the Sun Pixie drops, while others are more unique. Designed to fight after the golem.\n\nGigabat\nA massive cavern-fighting bat that summons a swarm of minions to defend itself and attack the player. Uniquely, it is triggered by the release of gems (crafted from gems and fireflies) in the cave layer. The more gems are released and the higher the level of the stone from which they are made, the faster the bat will arrive. Designed to fight shortly before the queen bee.\n\nStar construct\nThe boss is best described as an unholy, screaming mix of Golem, Planter, and a player who has just discovered grappling hooks, designed to fight around the same time as the world evil bosses (World Eater / Brain of Cthulhu). He sometimes falls from the sky while sleeping and can be awakened by hitting him multiple times, although the player can also summon him manually.\n\nEsophage\nA boss dedicated to both world disasters unlocks access to an alternate world evil after being defeated, designed to fight around the same time as Plantera. Surprisingly resembles a jumping spider.\n\nHemorrhage\nA much more powerful version of Esophagus that fought during the Blood Moon. Since the original wasn't creepy enough, it has longer and thinner legs. Designed to fight after the golem.\n\ntModLoader v0.11.8",
