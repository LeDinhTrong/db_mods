        "description": "The Block Development Mechanics mod introduces the mechanics of leveling up weapons in Terraria, allowing you to use them longer, constantly developing their capabilities. The level mechanics are borrowed from Example Mod, but they have received a significant number of improvements, making the system more balanced and detailed.\n\nFeatures of pumping:\n\nThe mod emulates leveling mechanisms typical for RPGs, where the higher the level, the more difficult it is to achieve, but the more significant the bonuses become.\nWeapons are not initially upgraded - this function must be activated, more about this in the “Runes” section.\nUpgraded weapons gain experience (XP) with each hit dealt, usually equivalent to the damage dealt.\nBosses, special events and worms have coefficients that reduce experience gained to avoid rapid leveling.\nThe experience required to level up increases dynamically with each new weapon level.\nThe weapon increases its damage output with each new level. The growth is small, but in total it gives significant bonuses.\nThe maximum level is 100; upon reaching it, the weapon receives triple damage.\nRunes:\n\nCraft items that activate a weapon's ability to gain XP and level up.\nIt is necessary to keep the weapon in the active inventory slot and right-click to use the rune from the inventory.\nDifferent runes set different \"Base XP\", which determines the difficulty of leveling up the weapon.\n\"Base XP\" indicates the amount of experience required to reach the first level and serves as the basis for all subsequent thresholds.\nThe rarity of a weapon determines which runes can be applied to it.\nThe higher the level of a rune, the later materials are required to create it and the more “Base XP” it brings.\nAll runes begin their journey with the “Slumbering Rune of Experience,” which can be crafted from 5 stones and a gem at a workbench.\n“Ethereal Runes” are special runes that apply to all types of weapons, allowing you to bypass restrictions and balance settings.\nExperience Orbs:\n\nRare items that drop from enemies and instantly grant experience to weapons.\nYou need to hold a weapon and right-click to use the orb from your inventory.\nThe experience gained depends on the size/type of the orb and the \"Base XP\" of the weapon.\nThere are 5 rarities of orb, the rarer ones are more powerful.\nThere is also a sixth, special type that gives one weapon level.\nOrbs drop in an inactive form and require cleaning at the appropriate station.\nAll orbs can be recycled into XP-reducing counterparts.\nLeveling up the player:\n\nAn experimental feature that allows players to increase their level.\nThe player's experience gain depends only on the configuration settings.\nThe player's experience is equal to the damage dealt, without exception, which corresponds to the total damage dealt for the entire game.\nThe experience requirements for players are much stricter than for weapons; To reach level 100 you need 10 billion XP!\nPlayer level can also increase damage, but much less and this feature is disabled by default.\nOther features:\n\nSound and text notifications about level up. Both types of notifications can be turned off.\nTooltips with information about XP, weapon level and power.\nInteraction with other mods and compatibility with another mod by the author - 'Weapon Augments'.\nSetting:\n\nA wide range of settings with detailed descriptions for fine-tuning the balance.\nEnabling and adjusting the strength of damage bonuses from levels.\nAdjust the speed of gaining XP and increasing weapon levels.\nAdjustment of maximum level, experience and damage boosts.\nCustomization of tooltips added by the mod.\nEnable/disable the drop of Experience Orbs.\nEnable/disable player leveling and accompanying damage increases.\nAnd much more!",

        "description": "Radiance is an expansion mod that buffs the Daylight Empress of Light as a stronger boss after Moonlord rather than before or after Golem.\n\nThe stats in the fight against the Empress of Light during the day have been adjusted, her attacks have flashy effects and modified behavior, making them more effective against end-phase movement options. In addition, powerful rewards are given out that enhance her primate items.\n\nCautions:\n\nFlashing lights are present. Some effects can be disabled, but not all.\nNot recommended for use with other difficulty mods. Daytime may be incorrect or unavailable, so it is necessary to disable them before the battle.\nThe balance in classic mode may be disrupted. You are expected to have and use movement items in Expert Mode. This may change in the future.\nChanges\n\nThe Empress of Light's attacks become much more difficult during the day and even more difficult in Master mode.\nEmpress of Light's attacks no longer deal absurd damage and can be dodged. Instead, multiple hits in succession are always fatal, regardless of health or defense, and dodging only partially reduces damage taken.\nThe Empress of Light is impervious to teleportation items during the day. The Rod of Harmony works like the Rod of Discord, and if the “Chaos State” debuff is present, all lost lives from the Empress are restored, which increases the duration of the battle.\nTerraprism is available at night as a reward for missing hits. This can be disabled in the configuration. It is also available during the day as a secondary trophy.\nobjects\n\nCrystal Bell: Given to the player after summoning the Empress of Light several times during the day. Can be used to endlessly summon her only during the daytime.\nRadiant Charm: Dropped by the Empress of Light during the day. Significantly increases the strength of her primate weapons and wings.\nShine Dye: Cosmetic item. Obtained as a reward for not hitting during the day. Good luck!\nHelp\n\nIf you are having difficulty (which is likely), make sure you have:\nCelestial Starboard + Floating Insignia - These are practically mandatory.\nSlime for faster fall. Although it is optional, it is very useful.",

This mod rethinks the yo-yo bag system, gives new effects to the previously bland and boring vanilla yo-yo, and offers many other new features.\n\nThe most important innovations in this mod include:\n\nImproved Yo-Yo Bag System\nNow the yo-yo bag is not limited to just a combination of glove, thread and counterweight. It provides additional customization slots, expanding your options without changing the core concept of the yo-yo bag.\nMeet the new NPC - Skeleton Shopkeeper\nNow the NPC Skeleton Shopkeeper has become the only seller of all yo-yo-related items. Code 1, counterweights and other accessories will not be available from other merchants. His store is extremely simple: as you progress through various bosses (with some exceptions), he will expand the selection. He has two different stores - one for yo-yos and another for accessories. It will appear in the world as soon as you get any yo-yo, but please note that some yo-yos from other mods may not work, so it is better to start with a wooden yo-yo and keep it in your inventory.\nUnique effects for each yo-yo\nNow each yo-yo has a unique effect, which can be passive or activated when a certain condition is met (for example, by wearing a certain accessory).\nWide selection of new yo-yos!\nThe mod offers a huge assortment of new yo-yos, so you always have a choice that suits your playstyle. From boss-themed yo-yos to true yo-yos, they'll let you show off your skills and tackle obstacles in style.\nIt's important to note that this mod does not strive to be completely balanced. Some items may be too powerful or, conversely, too weak. This doesn't mean the game will become too easy - just that some items will require further customization. The mod is in a very early stage of development, so there are plans to add new items and fix bugs in the future. ",

        "description": "Zenith is the most powerful weapon in the game and can only be obtained when there is nowhere else to use it.\n\nPerhaps you, like me, enjoy its mechanics and would like to play with it in a normal way. That's why I decided to create this mod, which allows you to get a weakened version of this sword on the first night by crafting it on an anvil of 10 fallen stars. Although the sword is weak, it can be improved simply by dealing damage. By right-clicking Zenith in your inventory, you can choose which stat will be improved, such as damage or attack speed. This way you can play through the entire game with it, gradually improving it, and it will eventually become much stronger than the original if you don't get bored. The configuration will help you get the right experience from this mod.\n\nIncreasing your critical strike chance above 100% makes sense since the excess chance increases the ultimate damage.",

        "description": "Nitrate (Performance Optimizer) is a mod for Terraria created to significantly improve the game's performance by introducing extensive optimizations to various functions. The mod takes advantage of parallelism, SIMD instructions, GPU rendering and other modern technical solutions designed to increase the speed and stability of the gameplay.\n\nPlease note:\nNitrate is in early development; Some features may not be compatible with other mods.\nBalance between performance and accuracy: We strive to find the perfect balance between game speed and visual fidelity.\nSave Security: Your saves should be safe, but visual distortions and glitches may occur.\n\nMain characteristics of the mod:\n\tDust particle processing: Rewritten and optimized for GPU, which significantly increases performance (requires testing with modified particles).\n\tParallelization of particle update: Increases game speed by simultaneous processing.\n\tRain visualization on GPU: optimized so that most of the processing occurs on the video card (may not work correctly with mods that change the textures or color of rain).\n\tParallelization of rain update: Increase productivity through more efficient processing.\n\tReplacing FNA types with SIMD: Important parts of the code now use JIT internal SIMD types to optimize execution.\n\tTiled rendering and lighting: rewritten to be chunk-based and partially processed on the GPU (the current version may have bugs, for example, when using spelunker potions).",

Problems may arise when used in conjunction with other mods and monitor requirements. Recommended use with caution.\n\nHigh FPS support:\nAllows Terraria to render over 60 frames per second without changing the speed of the world simulation.\nClient optimization:\nThe mod is completely client-side and does not affect server mechanics when playing in multiplayer mode.\nGame speed settings:\nIn a single-player game, configuration settings are available that allow you to speed up or slow down the game for fun.\nOptimizations for high FPS:\nIncludes several optimizations designed to help achieve high frame rates. These optimizations are disabled by default and can be enabled through the mod's config file.\nPotential problems:\n\nMonitor requirements:\nFor the mod to work correctly, you must disable the frame skip function in the game settings (“Frame Skip” must be set to “Off”), and also use a monitor with a refresh rate higher than 60 Hz.\nVisual glitches:\nOccasional minor visual inconsistencies or artifacts may occur.\nCompatibility with other mods:\nCompatibility with other mods is not guaranteed. Significant visual glitches may occur if other mods render objects in an incompatible manner. Solving these problems is only possible if the authors of other mods add support for this mod.",

Then equip it into your active accessory slot to have the contents of that chest added to your stats. It is limited by settings (default is disabled or set to 0) and each chest is only processed once, but you can share chests with other players.\nAdditionally, the chest accessory activator must be set up every time you enter a world (it doesn't save the chest it's on for common sense reasons), so every time you enter a world you need to open the accessory chest and use the activator chest accessories on it. This is a mod that does not aim to balance the game. Consider it a less cheating alternative to other similar mods.\nChanges in version 0.6:\n\nAdded piggy bank accessory activators as an alternative to filling the entire inventory with accessories:\nThey completely replace the use of the main inventory slots for accessories, so you cannot use, for example, an accessory activator from the bottom row with an accessory activator for a piggy bank.\nThey can still be equipped together, but only the one found first will be used.\nThe order of activating accessories and searching for armor is as follows: vanilla accessory slots, vanilla armor slots, hotbar, and then either the piggy bank or inventory from the first row to the last.\nThe ability to change configuration on servers has also been temporarily changed (you must be the first player on the server to make changes).",

        "description": "This mod aims to add variety to the world generation process without violating the core principles of the original generator, aiming to remain as close to the vanilla version as possible.\n\nMain features of the mod:\n\nCompatible with vanilla and custom seeds: The mod allows you to combine different seeds with vanilla and custom options, so you can enjoy both \"For the Worthy\" and \"Drunk\" world generation, as well as other variations.\nPossibility of choosing seeds: You can select different seed options using the gear icon located to the right of the seed input field in the world creation UI.\nDisabling secret seeds: The mod removes the standard way to activate secret seeds, so no seeds will trigger a secret anymore, they can only be activated through the options UI.\nAdditional world generation improvements: In the mod settings you can enable the recommended additional improvement in world generation. It changes the generation process slightly, but at the same time significantly speeds it up, especially for large worlds, and fixes some problems.\nSetting the world size: The mod also has the ability to customize the size of the world. It already works quite well, except for some graphical bugs associated with the vanilla version. Custom world size works best in combination with improved world generation and may be necessary in some cases. However, it's worth noting that if your world's width to height ratio is significantly different from vanilla, the generation may look unusual (at least for now).\nCompatible with other mods: This mod is compatible with almost all other mods and I try to fix problems as soon as they are reported. However, there is a known compatibility issue with the Calamity mod, but it should be fixed by the developers of this mod. In any case, this mod by itself cannot cause a problem. If someone tells you to turn it off, that's stupid. If you want to fix a problem with another mod yourself, pay attention to the following possible reasons:\nSome mods do not support the world size you choose, try to get closer to the vanilla size.\nSome options you have enabled may not be supported in combination with other mods.\nIt is possible that the additional generation enhancement option conflicts with another mod, although this is unlikely.",

While swinging the sword, monster spawns are also increased, due to the fact that you receive the Water Candle debuff.\nThe second sword added is the Night's Jungle.

Unlike the Blade of Grass, the Poisoned debuff is applied 100% of the time and lasts for 3 seconds.\nThe third sword added is the Night's Flame.

        "description": "The authors of The Polarities mod focused on adding new bosses to Terraria. At the same time, they emphasize the quality and compliance of the bosses with the vanilla style of play. Now in this mod there are 8 new bosses, new weapons, armor and other items.\n\nDetails about bosses\n\nThe polarities\nA couple of bosses that always remain on opposite sides of the player. They drop several powerful weapons and materials to create a unique set of armor, as well as a useful exclusive accessory for experts. Designed to fight after the golem.\nSun pixie\nA giant pixie that bombards the player with lasers and deadly beams. Drops several solar-themed weapons useful for mechanical bosses. Designed to fight up to furs.\n\nStorm Cloudfish\nAn early rain boss that drops several useful early game accessories and a rain switch. Designed to fight up to EoC.\n\nEclipxie\nA much more difficult version of the Sun Pixie that fought during a solar eclipse. Some of his drops are enhancements to the Sun Pixie drops, while others are more unique. Designed to fight after the golem.\n\nGigabat\nA massive cavern-fighting bat that summons a swarm of minions to defend itself and attack the player. Uniquely, it is triggered by the release of gems (crafted from gems and fireflies) in the cave layer. The more gems are released and the higher the level of the stone from which they are made, the faster the bat will arrive. Designed to fight shortly before the queen bee.\n\nStar construct\nThe boss is best described as an unholy, screaming mix of Golem, Planter, and a player who has just discovered grappling hooks, designed to fight around the same time as the world evil bosses (World Eater / Brain of Cthulhu). He sometimes falls from the sky while sleeping and can be awakened by hitting him multiple times, although the player can also summon him manually.\n\nEsophage\nA boss dedicated to both world disasters unlocks access to an alternate world evil after being defeated, designed to fight around the same time as Plantera. Surprisingly resembles a jumping spider.\n\nHemorrhage\nA much more powerful version of Esophagus that fought during the Blood Moon. Since the original wasn't creepy enough, it has longer and thinner legs. Designed to fight after the golem.\n\ntModLoader v0.11.8",
